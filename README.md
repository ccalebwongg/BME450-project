#project description:
  Accurately estimating a person's age from a facial image is a challenging problem in the field of computer vision and deep learning. Age estimation has various applications, including security systems, age-based content restriction, customer demographics analysis, and more. However, the task is complicated by factors such as variations in lighting, pose, expression, and individual aging patterns. In this project, I plan to use a neural network based model to estimate the age range of a person based on a single picture of their face. For the training and testing, I plan to use images of people from public online libraries with known ages as to get an accurate and representive data set. This includes data from the website 'paperswithcode.com', which provides databases of images of people of all ages (for example, UTKFace and MORPH).
