#project description
  In this project, I plan to use neural networks to recognize and translate hand signals in sign language. I plan to use public datasets from online libraries that provide educational content for people learning sign language. The overall goal of the project is to increase the accessibility and communication skills for people using hearing loss by providing non-sign language users a translation of the message being conveyed.
